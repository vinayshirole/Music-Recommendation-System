# Recommendation System using Content-Based Filtering

Welcome to our Content-Based Recommendation System project! This system utilizes content-based filtering techniques, including Cosine distance, Jaccard distance, Manhattan distance, and Euclidean distance, to provide personalized recommendations based on item content and user preferences.

## Project Overview

### Proposal
- [Proposal]([path/to/proposal.pdf](https://github.iu.edu/B565-Fall2023/project-kschatur-adiagark-vshirole/blob/main/Proposal.pdf))
- A 2-page proposal providing a basic idea about the data mining project.
- Introduces the motivation behind using content-based filtering for recommendations.

### Final Report
- [Final report]([path/to/final_report.pdf](https://github.iu.edu/B565-Fall2023/project-kschatur-adiagark-vshirole/blob/main/Data%20Mining%20final%20project%20report.pdf))
- Detailed documentation of the recommendation system project.
- Explanation of methodologies, challenges, and overall approach.
- Discussion of obtained results and their implications.

### Jupyter Notebook
- [Recommendation_system.ipynb]([path/to/recommendation_system.ipynb](https://github.iu.edu/B565-Fall2023/project-kschatur-adiagark-vshirole/blob/main/Music%20recommendation%20system.ipynb))
- Contains the final code for the recommendation system.
- Implementation of content-based filtering using various distance metrics.
- Step-by-step explanations, comments, and visualizations.

Follow these steps to reproduce our results and explore the recommendation system

**NOTE: Comment first 2 line of code if you are not using google collab. That code is basically used to mount the notebook on your google drive which has your dataset.**

Here we are using Spotify dataset for content-based-filtering and Spotify playlist dataset for Collaborative based filtering.
